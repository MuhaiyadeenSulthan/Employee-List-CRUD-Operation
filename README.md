This project is an Employee Management System developed using Java Spring Boot to manage employee data through CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 
It offers a user-friendly interface for efficient employee data management.

Key Features:
***************

  Add New Employee:
  ===================
            The "Add New Employee" button opens a form where users can input details such as the first name, last name, and email. 
            Once submitted, the new employee data is saved in the database, and the user is redirected to the home page.
  
  Employee List:
  ================
            The home page displays a table containing all employee records with columns for ID, First Name, Last Name, and Email. 
            The table includes sorting functionality for each column, allowing users to arrange records based on specific fields. 
            Pagination is also implemented for easy navigation through large datasets.

  Update and Delete Actions:
  =============================
            Update: The "Update" button lets users modify existing employee details. When clicked, it opens a pre-filled form for editing and saving changes.
            Delete: The "Delete" button allows users to remove an employee record from the database.

  This system ensures seamless management of employee data by providing essential functionalities, including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting records. 
  The interface is intuitive and designed for effective usability, making it suitable for small-scale applications.
